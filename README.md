Puppies in Augmented Reality

The long term goal of this project is to create unique, virtual companions in AR. Overtime, puppies will develop a unique personality based on your interactions and training.

They will also be able to play fetch and other games.

Currently, the project is capable of generating puppies with unique personalities.
